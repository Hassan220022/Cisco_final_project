# Cybersecurity Professional Program - Computer Networking Final Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to test the learner's level of knowledge and skills acquired through topics covered in the Computer Networking course. Topics include design and implementation of IP schemes, VLAN configuration, dynamic routing configuration, security solution implementation, and basic network device configuration.

## Mission
The mission is to set up a wide area network (WAN) for a mock bank that includes three LANs (one of which will be partitioned with three VLANs), and configure all network devices and endpoints to communicate with the entire WAN.

## Requirements
- Advanced knowledge of networking concepts and the Cisco IOS

## Resources
- Cisco Packet Tracer 8.0 or later
- NET-13-L1.pka file

## Instructions
Detailed instructions for the project are provided in the document. The instructions cover the following tasks:
- Design an IP Address Scheme
- Implement VLANs and Trunk
- Assign IP Addresses
- Configure R1 for Inter-VLAN Routing
- Secure Switch Physical Ports
- Configure OSPF
- Extended ACL
- Initial and Security Settings for Network Devices
- Secure Remote Access

Please follow the instructions carefully to complete the project.

## Note
Double-clicking the PKA file in your file explorer may not work (depending on the Packet Tracer version). Open the PKA file through the Cisco Packet Tracer menu by clicking File and then Open.
