# Socket Programming Bonus Task: Program Design and Description

Overall Program Design:
The program is designed to demonstrate socket programming in Python for both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) connections. It consists of two main components: a server and a client.

The server is responsible for listening for incoming connections or messages from clients. When a client connects or sends data, the server receives the data, reverses it, and sends the reversed data back to the client.

The client is responsible for connecting to the server (for TCP) or sending messages to the server (for UDP). It prompts the user to enter a string and sends it to the server. Upon receiving the response from the server (the reversed string), it displays the reversed string to the user.

How it Works:

1. TCP Implementation:
   - The server creates a TCP socket, binds it to a specific host and port, and starts listening for incoming connections.
   - The client creates a TCP socket and connects to the server using the specified host and port.
   - Once the connection is established, the client prompts the user to enter a string or 'exit' to quit.
   - If the user enters a string, the client sends the string to the server.
   - The server receives the string, reverses it, and sends the reversed string back to the client.
   - The client receives the reversed string and displays it to the user.
   - The process repeats until the user enters 'exit'.

2. UDP Implementation:
   - The server creates a UDP socket and binds it to a specific host and port.
   - The client creates a UDP socket and prompts the user to enter the server's host IP/name.
   - The client prompts the user to enter a string or 'exit' to quit.
   - If the user enters a string, the client sends the string to the server using the server's address.
   - The server receives the string, reverses it, and sends the reversed string back to the client.
   - The client receives the reversed string and displays it to the user.
   - The process repeats until the user enters 'exit'.

Design Tradeoffs:

- TCP provides a reliable, connection-oriented communication channel, but it has higher overhead due to the connection establishment and termination processes. UDP is a lightweight, connectionless protocol, but it doesn't guarantee reliable data delivery.
- In this program, TCP is used for scenarios where reliable data transfer is required, while UDP is used for scenarios where speed and efficiency are more important than reliability.

Possible Improvements and Extensions:

- Implement file transfer functionality using sockets.
- Add encryption and authentication mechanisms for secure communication.
- Extend the program to support additional protocols or network programming tasks.
